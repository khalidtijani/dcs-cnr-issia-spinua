## Developer Cloud Sandbox SPINUA application  

SPINUA (Stable Point INterferometry even over Unurbanized Areas) is a PSI-like algorithm originally developed for detection and monitoring of coherent targets (CT) in non- or scarcely- urbanized areas, extended for applications involving densely urbanized areas, as well as to assure proper processing of high resolution X-band data from both CSK and TSX. SPINUA through GEP will be used to derive deformation maps in Indonesia over test sites.

### <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started 

To run this application you will need a Developer Cloud Sandbox that can be requested at support (at) terradue.com

A Developer Cloud Sandbox provides Earth Sciences data access services, and helper tools for a user to implement, test and validate a scalable data processing application. It offers a dedicated virtual machine and a Cloud Computing environment.
The virtual machine runs in two different lifecycle modes: Sandbox mode and Cluster mode. 
Used in Sandbox mode (single virtual machine), it supports cluster simulation and user assistance functions in building the distributed application.
Used in Cluster mode (a set of master and slave nodes), it supports the deployment and execution of the application with the power of distributed computing for data processing over large datasets (leveraging the Hadoop Streaming MapReduce technology). 

### <a name="installation"></a>Installation

#### Using the development version

Install the pre-requisites as instructed above.

Log on the Developer Cloud Sandbox and run these commands in a shell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khalidtijani/dcs-cnr-issia-spinua.git
cd dcs-cnr-issia-spinua
ls 
Jenkinsfile  pom.xml  README.md  spinua  src
```

#### Pre-requisites


##### MATLAB Runtime

Run compiled MATLAB applications or components without installing MATLAB

The MATLAB Runtime is a standalone set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications or components on computers that do not have MATLAB installed.

To download and install the MATLAB Runtime:

The Release R2016b (MATLAB Runtime Version 9.1 and Linux platform that corresponds to the application or component you are using.

```bash
cd /home/${USER}
wget -c http://ssd.mathworks.com/supportfiles/downloads/R2016b/deployment_files/R2016b/installers/glnxa64/MCR_R2016b_glnxa64_installer.zip
```

Unzip the MATLAB Runtime installer at the terminal using the unzip command.
if you are unzipping the R2016b MATLAB Runtime installer, at the Terminal, type:

```bash
unzip MCR_R2016b_glnxa64_installer.zip -d MCR_R2016b_glnxa64_installer
cd MCR_R2016b_glnxa64_installer
./install -destinationFolder /home/$USER/MCR_R2016b
cd /home/${USER}
rm -rf MCR_R2016b_glnxa64_installer*
```

On the target computer, append the following to your STORAGE and SPINUA environment variable in the file /home/${USER}/.bashrc

```bash
vi /home/${USER}/.bashrc
```

Add two lines, Save and exit 

export STORAGE=/home/${USER}/storage

export SPINUA=/home/${USER}/dcs-cnr-issia-spinua/spinua/bin/GAP/gap_chain_v2.0

export MAINSPINUA=/home/${USER}/dcs-cnr-issia-spinua/spinua

```bash
source /home/${USER}/.bashrc
```

#### Install SPINUA-Step X0: The Splitter
The Step-On installation is quite straightforward, and it is performed with the Maven tool:
```bash
cd dcs-cnr-issia-spinua/
mvn clean install -D step.on=1 -P bash
```

With the last command you installed the first step-on SPINUA Chain (option -D) using a bash profile (option -P). The profile represents the programming language used to implement the Hands-On run executables.


Go to the applicationâ€™s default location (/application), by typing:
```bash
cd $_CIOP_APPLICATION_PATH
```
Check for a file named application.xml
Open it with a text editor (e.g. vi) and inspect its content. It will be similar to:

* [vi /application/application.xml](src/main/app-resources/spinua-step-1/application.xml)

A run executable is responsible for the execution of your application (or a step of it) by the Hadoop compute engine. In the application.xml we defined a workflow with a single node and the related run executable:

* [vi /application/splitter/run](src/main/app-resources/spinua-step-1/bash/splitter/run)


Run the node
List the available node(s) with:

```bash
ciop-run -n
```
This returns:

node_splitter

Execute it by typing:

```bash
ciop-run node_splitter
```

```bash


cd $STORAGE/S1splitter/outdir/stdout/    # outdir is the string that you choose as outfolder in application.xml  <parameter id="out">outdir</parameter>

ls 

Main_Spinua_Run_v2.0_stdout_2017.10.04_T14.04.33.266557272_cmdX0.txt

tail -f $STORAGE/S1splitter/outdir/stdout/Main_Spinua_Run_v2.0_stdout_2017.10.04_T14.04.33.266557272_cmdX0.txt
```

The result saved in this path $STORAGE/S1splitter/outdir/out 

Now we need to choose our dataset to be downloaded and used for the next Step of Spinua Chain.



#### Using the development version

Install the pre-requisites as instructed above.

Log on the Developer Cloud Sandbox and run these commands in a shell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khalidtijani/dcs-cnr-issia-spinua.git
cd dcs-cnr-issia-spinua
mvn clean install -D step.on=-id- -P bash
```

### <a name="submit"></a>Submitting the workflow

To submit the application with its default parameters, run the command below in the Developer Cloud Sandbox shell:

```bash
ciop-run
```
Or invoke the Web Processing Service via the Sandbox dashboard.
